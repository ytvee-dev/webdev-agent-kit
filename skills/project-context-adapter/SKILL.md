# Project Context Adapter

## Purpose

Refresh factual host-project context in `project/**` so reusable skills can
implement screenshot-derived specs without scanning the whole repository.

## When To Use

- Project structure, routes, entrypoints, styling systems, assets, or
  verification commands changed.
- A new frontend stack fact was discovered during implementation.
- Current skill capability declarations, available providers, or official
  documentation choices changed.
- Design-reference boundaries, approved patterns, or anti-patterns changed.
- Path indexes no longer match actual source files.

## When Not To Use

- First-time full onboarding in Plan Mode. Use `project-onboarding-adapter`.
- Reusable skill authoring. Use `agent-rules-skill-author`.
- Screenshot spec writing or implementation unless project facts changed.

## Required Context

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Confirm the classified task is `project-context-refresh` or a project
   context cache update required by another task.
3. Read `common/documentation-maintenance.md`.
4. Read existing `project/**` overlays.
5. Inspect relevant manifests, configs, entrypoints, routes, components,
   styles, assets, `tool-capabilities-manifest.json`, and verification scripts.
6. Read `references/extraction-checklist.md`.
7. Read `references/sync-procedure.md`.

Read targeted README sections only when the refresh concerns project intent, setup guidance, or documentation drift. Use `common/readme-policy.md` and confirm cached technical facts through higher evidence.

## Tool Contract

- Use Project Context MCP when available.
- Use filesystem reads and targeted search when Project Context MCP is
  unavailable.
- Use `context7` and MDN only when refreshing official documentation choices or
  stack-specific pattern notes that depend on current external docs.
- Activate `openai_platform_docs` only when refreshed project facts depend on current OpenAI or Codex behavior.
- Do not use Figma MCP.
- Edit only `project/**` unless the user also requests bundle skill or policy
  changes.

## Workflow

1. Determine which project facts changed.
2. Update only affected overlays or path indexes.
3. Refresh `project/mcp-profile.md` when skill capabilities, validated providers
   servers, official docs choices, or verification capabilities changed.
4. Refresh `project/design-reference-profile.md` when screenshot, exported
   asset, copied inspect, or design-source boundaries changed.
5. Refresh `project/approved-patterns.md` and `project/anti-patterns.md` only
   from real project code or official documentation for the detected stack.
6. Keep graph frontmatter current with `publishable: false` and
   `local_only: true`.
7. Keep host-project facts out of `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `common/**`,
   manifests, and reusable `skills/**`.
8. Verify updated facts against actual files or official documentation sources.

## Output Contract

Final response: return only facts that affect the user's understanding, confidence, or next action. Omit empty fields and workflow narration.

Report:

- overlays updated;
- source facts used;
- official documentation or MCP facts refreshed;
- project paths indexed or changed;
- verification performed;
- any project facts that remain unknown.

## Validation Gates

- `project/**` files must remain local-only.
- Path indexes must point to existing files or explicitly mark missing owners.
- `project/mcp-profile.md` must match active declarations in
  `tool-capabilities-manifest.json` when it is touched; provider config alone
  must not be recorded as availability.
- `project/design-reference-profile.md` must not imply live design-tool access.
- Patterns and anti-patterns must cite real local code facts or official
  documentation choices, not generic preferences.
- Reusable skills must not receive host-specific facts.
- README claims must not become project facts without confirmation from source, config, CI, package scripts, lockfiles, official documentation, or real results.
- Context refresh must not edit README unless the current user explicitly requests that README change.
- No Figma MCP or Figma whiteboard workflow may be introduced.

## Trigger Evals

Should trigger:

- "Refresh project context after this layout change."
- "Update .agents/project path indexes."
- "The styling profile is stale; sync it with the repo."

Should not trigger:

- "Create a design implementation spec from screenshots."
- "Implement this screen."
- "Plan first-time onboarding for a new project."
